# Tic Tac Toe

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns playing on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. The game highlights the winning move and announces a draw when the board is full and no player has won.
